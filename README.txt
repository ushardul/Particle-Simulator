A particle simulator that calculates forces between particles using gravitational forces and coulombic forces between particles and visually shows their trajectory. The simulation can be sped up or slowed down by factors and provides some details as to the background workings of the applications.

The force choices have not been implemented as of yet and so do not do anything.
